The Horde Team is pleased to announce the final release of the Turba Contact
Manager version H4 (3.0).

Turba is the Horde contact management application. Leveraging the Horde
framework to provide seamless integration with IMP and other Horde
applications, it supports storing contacts in SQL, LDAP, Kolab, and IMSP
address books.

To install Turba, you need to install Horde first. See
https://github.com/horde/horde/blob/master/horde/docs/INSTALL for details. Once
Horde is installed, you can install Turba with the following command:

  pear install horde/turba

Then log in to Horde with your adminstrator account to configure the
application and install the database schema from the configuration interface.

The major changes compared to the Turba version H4 (3.0-RC2) are:

    * Many small bugfixes and improvements.

The major changes compared to the Turba version H3 (2.3) are:

    * Updated for Horde 4.
    * Duplicates searching and merging.

The full list of changes can be viewed here:

The Horde Team.
