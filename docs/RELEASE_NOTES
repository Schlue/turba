The Horde Team is pleased to announce the first release candidate of the Turba
Contact Manager version H5 (4.0.0).

framework to provide seamless integration with IMP and other Horde
applications, it supports storing contacts in SQL, LDAP, Kolab, and IMSP
address books. For more information on Turba, visit

We encourage widespread testing and feedback via the mailing lists or our bug
tracking system. Updated translations are very welcome. Strings are not going

    * Improved support for email fields with multiple addresses.
