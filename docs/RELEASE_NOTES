The Horde Team is pleased to announce the first release candidate of the Turba
Contact Manager version H5 (4.2.0).

Turba is the Horde contact management application. Leveraging the Horde
framework to provide seamless integration with IMP and other Horde
applications, it supports contacts in SQL, LDAP, Kolab, IMSP, and Facebook
address books, and works as a CardDAV server. For more information on Turba,

Barring any problems, this code will be released as Turba H5 (4.2.0).  We
encourage widespread testing and feedback via the mailing lists or our bug
tracking system.  Updated translations are very welcome, strings should not
change before the final release.
