The Horde Team is pleased to announce the first beta release of the Turba
Contact Manager version H4 (3.0).

Turba is the Horde contact management application. Leveraging the Horde
framework to provide seamless integration with IMP and other Horde
applications, it supports storing contacts in SQL, LDAP, Kolab, and IMSP
address books.

IMPORTANT! This is a preview version that should not be used on production
systems. This version is considered feature complete but there are likely to be
bugs. You should not use this preview version with existing production
data. Migration of data from earlier versions has not been fully tested yet and
is not supported.

We encourage widespread testing and feedback via the mailing lists or our bug
tracking system. Updated translations are very welcome, though some strings
might still change before the release candidates are prepared.

To install Turba, you need to install Horde first. See
https://github.com/horde/horde/blob/master/horde/docs/INSTALL for details. Once
Horde is installed, you can install Turba with the following command:

  pear install horde/turba-beta

Then log in to Horde with your adminstrator account to configure the
application and install the database schema from the configuration interface.

The major changes compared to the Turba version H4 (3.0-ALPHA1) are:

    * Fixed exporting birthdays to calendars
    * Fixed importing contacts through SyncML

The full list of changes (from version H4 (3.0-ALPHA1)) can be viewed here:

Have fun!

The Horde Team.
